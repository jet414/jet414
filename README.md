- I'm going to 8th grade
- I'm in New York **STATE**
- I know Java, and a good amount of Python. I'm learning JavaScript and Bootstrap right now. HTML and CSS are also things I'm learning in parallel.
- I like to read and write, and my favorite book is *A Darkling Plain* by Philip Reeve. I have a lot of projects I'm writing, including two sci-fi novels, one a spy novel, one a space action novel
- My YouTube is @Halamcage. I don't post often, but it's there.
- Don't reach me yet. I'm not ready.
